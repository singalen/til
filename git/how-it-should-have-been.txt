Linus Torwalds' "coolest git merge ever".

per http://stackoverflow.com/a/1684435/207791: 
* it appears in the Git repository as if it had always been developed as part of Git,
* all the history is kept intact and
* it can still be developed independently in its old repository, with changes simply being git pulled.

	git fetch <project-to-union-merge>
	GIT_INDEX_FILE=.git/tmp-index git-read-tree FETCH_HEAD
	GIT_INDEX_FILE=.git/tmp-index git-checkout-cache -a -u
	git-update-cache --add -- (GIT_INDEX_FILE=.git/tmp-index git-ls-files)
	cp .git/FETCH_HEAD .git/MERGE_HEAD
	git commit
